# Freelance Opportunity: Python Developer for Network Metrics Functions

**Client:** Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA), Leipzig, Germany\
**Location:** Remote\
**Contract Type:** Freelance

The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology is seeking a freelance Python developer to support the final development phase of a **Bayesian inference software package**. This role will focus on implementing key **graph-theoretic metrics**—**betweenness centrality** and **modularity**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Scope

-   Develop and optimize functions for key network metrics within a Bayesian inference context.
-   Leverage **Python** and **JAX** for high-performance numerical computations.
-   Collaborate remotely with the research team to ensure smooth integration of functionalities.
-   Write clear, efficient, and well-documented code suitable for long-term use and extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Required Skills

-   Proficiency in **Python**, with experience using **JAX** or other array-based computing libraries.
-   Strong understanding of **graph theory** and **network analysis**.
-   Familiarity with **Bayesian inference** and probabilistic programming is a strong plus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Estimated Timeline

We estimate the following approximate time requirements for each component of the project:

- **Betweenness Centrality**: 20–30 hours
- **Modularity**: 20–30 hours
- **Total Estimate**: ~40-60 hours

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We look forward to hearing from you!
