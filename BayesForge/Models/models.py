    The models class serves as a high-level interface for managing and utilizing various Bayesian models within the BF framework. It encapsulates different model types such as DPMM, GMM, NBDA, and others, providing a unified structure for model initialization, fitting, and diagnostics. This class is designed to simplify the process of working with complex Bayesian models, allowing users to easily switch between different model types and access their functionalities through a consistent API.
