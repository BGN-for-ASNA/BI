"""Centralised random-number management for BayesForge.

A single :class:`RNG` instance owns the reproducibility contract for an
``bf`` model. It is built once from the constructor's ``rand_seed`` argument
and is the single source of truth for every random draw in the package.

Two access patterns are exposed, because inference engines and ad-hoc
distribution draws have different needs:

* :meth:`key` -- a *stable* key derived deterministically from the base seed
  and a string label (via ``jax.random.fold_in``). Used by the inference
  engines (``fit``, ``svi``, ``sample``, ``log_prob``) so that repeated calls
  to the same method reproduce, ``fit`` and ``svi`` differ from one another,
  and the result is independent of how many ad-hoc draws happened before it.

* :meth:`stream` -- a *fresh, independent* sub-key on every call, produced by
  splitting a stored key. Used by direct ``m.dist.XXX(sample=True)`` draws so
  that consecutive draws are statistically independent (no correlation between
  e.g. a Normal and an Exponential drawn back-to-back) while the whole
  sequence stays reproducible from a fixed base seed.

Seed semantics (matching the historical ``rand_seed`` contract):

* ``rand_seed=False`` -> base seed ``0`` (reproducible).
* ``rand_seed=<int>`` -> base seed = that integer (reproducible).
* ``rand_seed=True``  -> base seed drawn from entropy (non-reproducible), but
  stored so it can be reported via :meth:`get_seed` and replayed later.
