    "# The conceptual foundations\n",
    "There are two main NBDA variants: order-of-acquisition diffusion analysis (OADA), which takes as data the order in which individuals acquired the target behaviour, and time-of-acquisition diffusion analysis (TADA), which uses the times of acquisition of the target behaviour. TADA can be further subdivided into versions that treat time as either a continuous variable (continuous TADA or ‘cTADA’) or as a discrete variable split into units (discrete TADA or ‘dTADA’). Choice of OADA versus cTADA versus dTADA depends on the diffusion data available and the assumptions one is willing to make about how the rate of learning changes over time (i.e. the shape of the baseline rate function, λo(t)). \n",
    "\n",
    "OADA makes no assumptions about the shape of $λ_o(t)$, but only assumes that this function is the same for every individual in the diffusion. In contrast, TADA requires a researcher to make assumptions about the form of $λ_o(t)$, and fit parameters controlling its shape. When these assumptions are met, TADA offers more statistical power than OADA (Hoppitt, Boogert, et al., 2010), particularly when the network is densely connected with little variation in connection strength. Indeed, when the network is completely homogeneous (i.e. all possible connections exist and are of equal strength), OADA cannot distinguish social transmission from asocial learning since all orders of acquisition would be equally likely in both models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, one can fit a TADA that assumes a constant baseline learning rate, $λ_o(t) = λ_o$, with an extra parameter, $λ_o$, fitted to the data (Franz & Nunn, 2009; Hoppitt, Boogert, et al., 2010). However, this assumption may often not hold—for example, individuals might initially exhibit neophobic responses towards a learning task, but as neophobia fades over time, asocial learning rates should increase. Such circumstances can cause a spurious positive result for social transmission in a TADA (Hoppitt, Kandler, Kendal, & Laland, 2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, TADA can be modified to have a non-constant baseline rate. Although any positive function can be specified for $λ_o(t)$, the $NBDA$ package has two functions built-in which will be sufficient in most cases. One corresponds to a *gamma* distribution of latencies under asocial learning (Hoppitt, Kandler, et al., 2010), and the other to a *Weibull* distribution of latencies (a common choice in survival analysis; Moore, 2016). Both offer flexible modelling of λo(t) with a shape parameter that allows for the possibility of systematically increasing, decreasing or constant baseline functions.\n",

    "### Previous formulation of time of acquisition diffusion analysis\n",
    "There are two parameters of interest in the basic time of acquisition diffusion analysis model: the rate of social transmission be-tween individuals per unit of network connection,*s*, and the baseline rate of trait performance in the absence of social transmission, $λ_0$ . Throughout this chapter, we refer to the s parameter as the social transmission parameter, and to $λ_0$  as the baseline parameter. The hazard function for the model is expressed as:\n",

    "Previous versions of time of acquisition diffusion analysis allow for an increasing or decreasing baseline rate $\\lambda_0 (t)$ (Hoppitt, Kandler,et al. 2010). Here, we restrict ourselves to expanding the version for a constant baseline rate (i.e. $\\lambda_0(t) = \\lambda_0$) (Hoppitt, Boogert, et al. 2010), although the version for a non-constant baseline rate can be expanded in the same way."

    "Here, we show how a basic OADA model, containing only a single parameter, s, is fitted to the data by maximum likelihood. Note that this process is carried out automatically by the NBDA package (Hoppitt et al. 2019) when fitting an OADA model, but it is useful for a researcher to understand how the model is fitted. Maximum likelihood works by finding the values of the parameters for which the observed data is most likely. This is done by first deriving a likelihood function that specifies the likelihood of the data for a given set of parameter values. For OADA, the likelihood for a single acquisition event, E, is:\n",

    "$$L(E) = \\frac{\\lambda_e (t_E) }{\\sum_{l = 1}^{N} \\lambda_l (t_E)}$$\n",

In other words,  $L_E$ is the probability that e would be the next individual to learn, which is the rate of learning for e at time  $t_E$, divided by the sum of rates for everyone in the population, $\\sum_{l = 1}^{N} \\lambda_l (t_E)$. If we define the relative rate of learning to be:\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\lambda_0 (t)$ drops out of the likelihood function. The likelihood function for the whole diffusion, L, is the product of the likelihoods for all acquisition events. In principle, the value of s could be chosen to directly maximise the likelihood. However, for computational stability, one equivalently takes the negative logarithm of the likelihoods for each event and adds them together, -log(L), then finds the value of s that minimizes -log(L), where:\n",

When there is more than one parameter in the model, the optimization algorithm finds the combination of parameter values that minimizes -log(L). A review of the likelihood functions for NBDA, including cTADA and dTADA, is found in Hoppitt and Laland (2013)."

    "## Why do we need Bayesian networkbased diffusion analysis?\n",
    "- The expansion of network-based diffusion analysis to multiple diffusions could also be valuable where researchers have repeated diffusions\n",
    "across the same group, or groups, of animals (e.g. Boogert et al. 2008), especially when they only have a limited number of animals, allowing them to obtain good statistical power. However, a statistical problem arises if they fail to account for the fact that the same individuals are involved in multiple diffusions. By including an individual random effect on the asocial rate of learning, the model accounts for the fact that the same individuals have the same (or similar) asocial learning ability in each diffusion. However, random effects can be difficult to implement using maximum likelihood methods (used to fit network-based diffusion analysis models thus far), especially when the random effects structure is complex, because one has to integrate the likelihood function across all the possible values the random effects could take. It is easier to include random effects in a Bayesian model, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Gelman et al. 2004).\n",
