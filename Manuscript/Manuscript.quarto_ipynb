        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian modeling has emerged as a vital tool in modern statistics and machine learning, providing a framework for robust inference under uncertainty. Despite its potential, the current ecosystem of Bayesian software presents significant challenges for researchers, particularly due to limited formal training in Bayesian methods and model development, coding languages diversity, scalability, and the specialized nature of many Bayesian frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key obstacles in Bayesian modeling is the limited formal training many researchers receive in Bayesian methods and model development. Although Bayesian inference has gained traction, the complexity of model formulation, coupled with the need for a deeper understanding of probabilistic frameworks, can be overwhelming. The gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application often results in users defaulting to more simplistic models that may not fully leverage the power of Bayesian analysis. For instance, while accessible frameworks like BRMS exist, they are typically constrained to linear regression models with flat priors. This reflects the predominance of linear regression in many fields, where statistical analysis often relies heavily on techniques that are commonly emphasized in educational settings. As a result, the potential of Bayesian methods remains underutilized in more complex, real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another significant barrier to the adoption of Bayesian tools is the diversity of coding languages used across various frameworks. Researchers often face the challenge of learning multiple programming languages, each associated with a specific Bayesian tool, which can complicate the model development process and create inefficiencies. For example, while Stan remains a gold standard in Bayesian inference due to its highly optimized sampling algorithms and broad support for various models, it requires users to learn and write models in its own specialized syntax (Stan code). For researchers accustomed to working in Python or R, the need to switch to a different programming environment can be a considerable hurdle. Additionally, Stan faces challenges related to scaling, particularly in the parallelization of operations and the utilization of GPU resources, which can limit its efficiency when handling large datasets or complex models. For researchers accustomed to working in Python or R, the need to switch to a different programming environment can be a considerable hurdle. This added cognitive load makes the modeling process more labor-intensive, particularly for those without extensive expertise in multiple programming languages. As a result, users may be discouraged from fully exploring the capabilities of Bayesian methods due to the friction introduced by these language barriers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many Bayesian modeling tools are specialized for specific types of models or applications, which can limit their flexibility and broader utility. Although these frameworks often excel in their respective domains, their specialization can introduce barriers for users looking to apply Bayesian inference to a wider array of problems. For example, TensorFlow Probability (TFP) provides a robust framework for probabilistic modeling within the TensorFlow ecosystem. However, a significant challenge arises from the requirement that users frequently need to build their own Bayesian samplers—algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which are critical for generating samples from the posterior distribution. This complexity, combined with the steep learning curve of the TensorFlow infrastructure, can deter researchers who are not already familiar with the system’s intricacies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, specialized tools like STRAND and BISON highlight the trade-offs inherent in current Bayesian software. STRAND and BISON excels at modeling network, yet its narrow focus can result in limited flexibility when adapting to more general Bayesian modeling needs such as computing network metrics within the same model. And as both are based on STAN, they also face challenges related to scalability and parallelization, which can limit their efficiency when handling large datasets which in the context of network can arrive at the order of magnitude of the number of nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these limitations, there is a clear need for a more user-friendly, scalable, and versatile Bayesian modeling tool that can address the gaps in the current software landscape. Our proposed Python software aims to meet this need by providing a platform that combines the power of Bayesian inference with greater accessibility and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for both novice and experienced users. This software leverages the computational efficiency of JAX by using either TensorFlow Probability (TFP) or NumPyro as its backbone structure, while simplifying the process of model specification and retaining their flexibility and power (including parallelization of operations and the utilization of GPU resources).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Software Presentation\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Bayesian Inference (BI) software comes in two versions: one relying on NumPyro and the other on TFP. We have simplified the process of model specification by providing a more user-friendly interface for defining Bayesian models, making it accessible to both novice users and experienced practitioners. Since both NumPyro and TFP rely on JAX, we inherit the advantages of JAX, including speed, parallelization, scalability, and GPU support. The user code remains consistent for running parallelized mathematical operations and utilizing either GPU or CPU. From start to finish, users can employ a class object to: 1) handle data, 2) define models, 3) specify inference algorithms, 4) run inference, 5) compute posterior distributions, 6) compute model predictions, and 7) plot results. Additionally, as one of the major issue in the research area is the lack of training on bayesian modeling, we present 20 different models to cover wide range of research questions. All presented models are accompanied by detailed explanations, making it easier for users to understand the underlying assumptions and apply the models to their specific research questions.\n",

        "A primary feature of our Bayesian Inference (BI) software is its user-friendly interface designed for defining Bayesian models. We understand that Bayesian modeling can be daunting, especially for those who may lack formal training in the subject. To mitigate this, our interface offers a simplified version of the NumPyro and TFP functions. Typically, to define a parameter in a model, both libraries require three different functions. We have merged these functions into one, along with the sampling functions that are separated in NumPyro and TFP. The code below illustrates the differences between NumPyro, TFP, and BI for declaring a parameter of length 10 that follows a Normal distribution within a model.\n"
