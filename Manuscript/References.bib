abstract = {Abstract Data collection biases are a persistent issue for studies of social networks. This issue has been particularly important in animal social network analysis (ASNA), where data are often unevenly sampled and such biases may potentially lead to incorrect inferences about animal social behaviour. Here, we address the issue by developing a Bayesian model, which not only estimates network structure but also explicitly accounts for sampling and censoring biases. Using a set of simulation experiments designed to reflect various sampling and observational biases encountered in real-world scenarios, we systematically validate our model and evaluate its performance relative to other common ASNA methodologies. By accounting for differences in node-level censoring (i.e. individual variation in undetected ties), our model permits the recovery of true latent social connections, even under a wide range of conditions where some key individuals are intermittently unobserved. Our model outperformed all other existing approaches and accurately captured network structure, as well as individual-level and dyad-level effects. Antithetically, permutation-based and simple linear regression approaches performed the worst across many conditions. These results highlight the advantages of generative network models for ASNA, as they offer greater flexibility, robustness and adaptability to real-world data complexities. Our findings underscore the importance of generative models that jointly estimate network structure and measurement biases typical in empirical studies of animal social behaviour.}

abstract = {Abstract Animal social networks are often constructed from point estimates of edge weights. In many contexts, edge weights are inferred from observational data, and the uncertainty around estimates can be affected by various factors. Though this has been acknowledged in previous work, methods that explicitly quantify uncertainty in edge weights have not yet been widely adopted and remain undeveloped for many common types of data. Furthermore, existing methods are unable to cope with some of the complexities often found in observational data, and do not propagate uncertainty in edge weights to subsequent statistical analyses. We introduce a unified Bayesian framework for modelling social networks based on observational data. This framework, which we call BISoN, can accommodate many common types of observational social data, can capture confounds and model effects at the level of observations and is fully compatible with popular methods used in social network analysis. We show how the framework can be applied to common types of data and how various types of downstream statistical analyses can be performed, including non-random association tests and regressions on network properties. Our framework opens up the opportunity to test new types of hypotheses, make full use of observational datasets, and increase the reliability of scientific inferences. We have made both an R package and example R scripts available to enable adoption of the framework.},

    abstract = {Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

    abstract = {Programs for Bayesian inference of phylogeny currently implement a unique and ﬁxed suite of models. Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study, while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs. We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-graphical models can be speciﬁed interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-speciﬁcation language, and should be easy to learn for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous ﬂexibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate, RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models in our ﬁeld. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model choices that we make to critical scrutiny.
