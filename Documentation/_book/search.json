These relative plausibilities are the posterior probabilities of each combination of values µ and σ: the posterior distributions.

    "text": "Network links can be modeled using Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, or zero-inflated Poisson distributions. So, by replacing the Poisson distribution with a binomial distribution, we can model the existence or absence of link weights — i.e., model binary networks.\nNote that if the network is undirected, then accounting for correlation between propensity to emit and receive links is not necessary, and the terms ( _i ), ( j ), and ( {ij} ) are no longer required. (Is it correct?)\nIn the following chapters, we will see how to incorporate additional network effects into the model to account for network structural properties (e.g., clusters, assortativity, triadic closure, etc.).",
