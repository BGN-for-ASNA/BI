# Multilayer Networks
## General Principles
A multilayer network is a broader term that refers to networks composed of multiple layers, where each layer may have its own set of nodes and edges, potentially representing different types of entities and interactions. This means the nodes can be the same or different across layers.

##  Considerations
- We have the same considerations as for [Network model](19.&#32;Network&#32;model.qmd).
## Example

## Mathematical Details
### *Formula*
### *Bayesian model (WIP)*

# Notes
- We can apply sender-receiver model [19.1. Sender receiver network model.](19.1.&#32;Sender&#32;receiver&#32;network&#32;model.qmd).

- We can apply block model [19.2. Block model network.qmd](3.&#32;Block&#32;model&#32;network.qmd).
