The BI class can import data from a csv file or from a dictionary for data that can't be stored in a tabular format.

## Import tabular data from a csv file
::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Python
``` python
m.data(data_path, sep=';') 
```
## R
``` R
m$data(data_path,  sep=';')
```
:::

## Import non tabular data
First you need to create our own dictionary with the data.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Python
``` python
m.data_on_model = dict(
    ID1 = Value1,
    ID2 = Value2, 
)

```

## R
``` R
keys <- c("ID1","ID2")
values <- list(Value1,Value2)
data = py_dict(keys, values, convert = TRUE)
m$data_on_model=data
```
:::

## Handle data
For tabular data, you ca use some functions to manipulate the data:

-   **Perform one-hot encoding** ```OHE```: One-hot encoding is a technique that converts categorical variables into binary variables. This is useful when you have a large number of categories and want to use them as features in a model.

-   **Create index encoding for categorical columns** ```index```: Index encoding is a technique that assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable. This is useful when you have a large number of categories and want to use them as features in a model.

-   **Scale** ```scale```: Standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
