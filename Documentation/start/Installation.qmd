You can run BI on python or R. For R users you need to have installed python and the R [**reticulate**](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).

## Python
``` python
#| code-fold: false
pip install BayesInference # For CPU support
pip install BayesInference[gpu] # For GPU support 
```

## R
``` R
#| code-fold: false
package.install(BayesianInference)
```

::: callout-note
* As reticulate use it's own python environment, you need to install the python version of BI through reticulate. You can do this by running the following command in R:
  
    ``` R
    reticulate::py_install("BayesianInference", pip = TRUE)
    ```

* GPU support is only available for linux and WSL2 systems.
