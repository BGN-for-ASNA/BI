::: callout-note
* As reticulate use it's own python environment, you need to install the python version of BI through reticulate. You can do this by running the following command in R:
  
    ``` R
    reticulate::py_install("BayesianInference", pip = TRUE)
    ```

* GPU support is only available for linux and WSL2 systems.
