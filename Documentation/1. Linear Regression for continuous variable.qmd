# Linear Regression for continuous vairable
## General Principles
To study relationships between two continuous variables (e.g. heigth and weigth), we can use : _Linear regression approach_. Basically, we draw a line that cross the points clouds of the two tested variables. For this we need to have: 1) an intercept $\alpha$ which inform us about the starting point of the line, 2) a coefficient $\beta$ which in inform us about the slope of the line and 3) a error term $\sigma$ which inform us about spread of points between the line. We can interpret the intercept $\alpha$  as the mean for of _Y_ for the smaller value of _X_, the coefficient $\beta$ as how much _Y_ increase for each increment of  _X_, and $\sigma$ as the error arround the prediction. So the coefficient $\beta$ give the strength of the relationship between _X_ and _Y_ and $\sigma$ the amount of error in the model.

## Conciderations
- Bayesian linear regression considers uncertainty in the model parameters and provides a full posterior distribution over them. We thus need to decalre prior distribution for  $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ . 

- Ussually, we use _Normal_ distribution for  $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and an _exponential_ or _Uniform_ distributiuon for $\sigma$.

- As we concider that data is standardized (see introduction) we use a distribution of mean 0 and of standard deviation of 1.

- $\sigma$ is assumed to be normally distributed and is squared to force positive error and account for values bellow and above the line.

- Gaussian regression deals directly with continuous outcomes, estimating a linear relationship between predictors and the outcome variable without needing a link function. This simplifies interpretation, as coefficients represent direct changes in the outcome variable.

## Example

Below is an example code snippet demonstrating Bayesian linear regression using Bayesian Inference (BI) package:

```{pyodide}
#from .bi.main import*#

## Setup device------------------------------------------------
#m = bi(platform='cpu')#

## Import data ------------------------------------------------
#m.data('../data/Howell1.csv', sep=';') 
#m.df = m.df[m.df.age > 18]
#m.scale(['weight'])
#m.data_to_model(['weight', 'height'])#

## Define model ------------------------------------------------
#def model(height, weight):    
#    alpha = dist.normal( 178, 20, name = 'alpha')
#    beta = dist.normal(  0, 1, name = 'beta')   
#    sigma = dist.uniform( 0, 50, name = 'sigma')
#    lk("Y", Normal(alpha + beta * weight , sigma), obs = height)#

## Run mcmc ------------------------------------------------
#m.run(model) #

## Summary ------------------------------------------------
#m.sampler.print_summary(0.89)
1+1
```

## Mathematical Details
### *Formula*
The following equation allow us to draw a line and is ths one that is most used in statistic clases:
$$
Y = \alpha + \beta  X + \sigma
$$

Where:
- _Y_ is the target variable.
- _X_ is the input variable.
- $\beta$ is the regression coefficient.
- $\alpha$ is the intercept term.
- $\sigma$ is the error term.

### *Bayesian model*
The equivalent version of the Bayesian linear regression model using probability distributions is as follows:
$$
p(Y | X, \alpha , \beta ) = Normal(\alpha + \beta   X, \sigma)
$$

$$
p(\alpha) = Normal(0, 1)
$$

$$
p(\beta) = Normal(0, 1)
$$

$$
p(\sigma) = Uniform(0, 50)
$$


Where:
- $p(Y |X, \alpha , \beta)$ is the likelihood function (equivalent of the line equation).
- $p(\beta)$ and $p(\alpha)$ are the prior distributions for the regression coefficients and intercept, respectivelly.
- $p(\sigma)$, controll the variance of the likelihood.
