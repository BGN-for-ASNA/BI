# Measuring error
## General Principles
Measuring error refers to the variability in the measurement of a variable, which can be caused by various factors such as measurement error, sampling error, or measurement bias. It is an important consideration in many fields, including statistics, economics, and engineering, where accurate measurements are crucial for making informed decisions.

In order to account for measurement error, we can use a measurement error model. This model assumes that the measurement of a variable is subject to measurement error, which can be modeled using a probability distribution. The model can be used to estimate the parameters of the measurement error distribution, such as the mean and variance, and to make predictions about the measurements based on the estimated parameters.

Additionally, measurement error can be generated by several factors, such as sampling bias, censoring bias, and group size heterogeneity.

Measurement error models are composed models (i.e., models with sub-models) that evaluate different generative processes, starting with the measurement error process, which is then used to generate the observed data.


## Example
Below is an example code snippet demonstrating Bayesian Measuring error model using the Bayesian Inference (BI) package. The data  consist of three continuous variables (marriage rate, divorce rates, age), and the goal is to estimate the effect of age and marriage rate on divorce rates, while considering that your divorce rate is have a measurement error.

## Mathematical Details
### *Bayesian formulation*

$$
D_i^* \sim Normal(D_i, \sigma_i)
$$

$$
D_i \sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma)
$$

$$
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_A A_i + \beta_M M_i 
$$

$$
\sigma \sim Normal(1)
$$

where:

- $D_i^*$ is the observed divorce rate.

- $D_i$ is the true divorce rate.

- $\mu_i$ is the mean of the true divorce rate.

- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the true divorce rate.

- $\alpha$ is the intercept term.

- $\beta_A$ is the regression coefficient for age.

- $\beta_M$ is the regression coefficient for marriage rate.    


## Notes
::: callout-note
This is am approach that can be extended to any kind of models previously described. For example, one could generate a bernoulli measurement error model by generating the process of probability of success and of failure.
