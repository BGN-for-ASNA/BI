# Multiplex Networks
## General Principles
A multiplex network is a type of multilayer network where all layers consist of the same set of nodes, but the links between them differ. Each layer represents a different type of relationship or interaction between the same entities (nodes).


##  Considerations
- We have the same considerations as for [Network model](19.&#32;Network&#32;model.qmd).
## Example

## Mathematical Details
### *Formula*
### *Bayesian model (WIP)*

# Notes
- We can apply sender-receiver model [19.1. Sender receiver network model.](19.1.&#32;Sender&#32;receiver&#32;network&#32;model.qmd).

- We can apply block model [19.2. Block model network.qmd](3.&#32;Block&#32;model&#32;network.qmd).
