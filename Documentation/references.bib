abstract = {Abstract Although social learning capabilities are taxonomically widespread, demonstrating that freely interacting animals (whether wild or captive) rely on social learning has proved remarkably challenging. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) offers a means for detecting social learning using observational data on freely interacting groups. Its core assumption is that if a target behaviour is socially transmitted, then its spread should follow the connections in a social network that reflects social learning opportunities. Here, we provide a comprehensive guide for using NBDA. We first introduce its underlying mathematical framework and present the types of questions that NBDA can address. We then guide researchers through the process of selecting an appropriate social network for their research question; determining which NBDA variant should be used; and incorporating other variables that may impact asocial and social learning. Finally, we discuss how to interpret an NBDA model's output and provide practical recommendations for model selection. Throughout, we highlight extensions to the basic NBDA framework, including incorporation of dynamic networks to capture changes in social relationships during a diffusion and using a multi-network NBDA to estimate information flow across multiple types of social relationship. Alongside this information, we provide worked examples and tutorials demonstrating how to perform analyses using the newly developed nbda package written in the R programming language.},

abstract = {Abstract We provide an overview of the most commonly used social network measures in animal research for static networks or time-aggregated networks. For each of these measures, we provide clear explanations as to what they measure, we describe their respective variants, we underline the necessity to consider these variants according to the research question addressed, and we indicate considerations that have not been taken so far. We provide a guideline indicating how to use them depending on the data collection protocol, the social system studied and the research question addressed. Finally, we inform about the existent gaps and remaining challenges in the use of several variants and provide future research directions.},
