abstract = {Abstract We provide an overview of the most commonly used social network measures in animal research for static networks or time-aggregated networks. For each of these measures, we provide clear explanations as to what they measure, we describe their respective variants, we underline the necessity to consider these variants according to the research question addressed, and we indicate considerations that have not been taken so far. We provide a guideline indicating how to use them depending on the data collection protocol, the social system studied and the research question addressed. Finally, we inform about the existent gaps and remaining challenges in the use of several variants and provide future research directions.},
