## General Principles

To discover group structures or clusters in data, we can use a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**. This is a [parametric 🛈]{style="color:#0D6EFD"} clustering method. A GMM assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of a **pre-specified number (`K`)** of different Gaussian distributions. The model's goal is to figure out:

1.  **The properties of each of the `K` clusters**: For each of the `K` clusters, it estimates its center (mean $\mu$) and its shape/spread (covariance $\Sigma$).
2.  **The mixture weights**: It estimates the proportion of the data that belongs to each cluster.
3.  **The assignment of each data point**: It determines the probability of each data point belonging to each of the `K` clusters.

## Considerations

::: callout-caution
-   A GMM is a Bayesian model 🛈 that considers uncertainty in all its parameters, *except for the number of clusters, `K`*, which must be fixed in advance.

-   The key parameters and their priors are:

    -   **Number of Clusters `K`**: This is a **fixed hyperparameter** that you must choose before running the model. Choosing the right `K` often involves running the model multiple times and using model comparison criteria (like cross-validation, AIC, or BIC).
    -   **Cluster Weights `w`**: These are the probabilities of drawing a data point from any given cluster. Since there are a fixed number `K` of them and they must sum to 1, they are typically given a `Dirichlet` prior. A symmetric `Dirichlet` prior (e.g., `Dirichlet(1, 1, ..., 1)`) represents an initial belief that all clusters are equally likely.
    -   **Cluster Parameters (**$\boldsymbol{\mu}$, $\Sigma$): Each of the `K` clusters has a mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. We place priors on these to define our beliefs about their plausible values.

-   Like the DPMM, the model is often implemented in its [marginalized form 🛈]{style="color:#0D6EFD"}. Instead of explicitly assigning each data point to a cluster, we integrate out this choice. This creates a smoother probability surface for the inference algorithm to explore, leading to much more efficient computation.
  
- To increase accuracy we run a k-means algorithm to initialize the cluster mean priors.

## Example

Below is an example of a GMM implemented in BI. The goal is to cluster a synthetic dataset into **a pre-specified `K=4` groups**.

## Python

```python
from BI import bi
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate synthetic data
data, true_labels = make_blobs(
    n_samples=500, centers=8, cluster_std=0.8,
    center_box=(-10,10), random_state=101
)


#  The model
def gmm(data, K, initial_means): # Here K is the *exact* number of clusters
    D = data.shape[1]  # Number of features
    alpha_prior = 0.5 * jnp.ones(K)
    w = dist.dirichlet(concentration=alpha_prior, name='weights') 

    with dist.plate("components", K): # Use fixed K
        mu = dist.multivariatenormal(loc=initial_means, covariance_matrix=0.1*jnp.eye(D), name='mu')        
        sigma = dist.halfcauchy(1, shape=(D,), event=1, name='sigma')
        Lcorr = dist.lkjcholesky(dimension=D, concentration=1.0, name='Lcorr')

        scale_tril = sigma[..., None] * Lcorr

    dist.mixturesamefamily(
        mixing_distribution=dist.categorical(probs=w, create_obj=True),
        component_distribution=dist.multivariatenormal(loc=mu, scale_tril=scale_tril, create_obj=True),
        name="obs",
        obs=data
    )

m.data_on_model = {"data": data,"K": 4 }
m.fit(gmm) # Optimize model parameters through MCMC sampling
m.plot(X=data,sampler=m.sampler) # Prebuild plot function for GMM

## Mathematical Details

This section describes the generative process for a GMM. 

$$
Z_i \sim \text{Categorical}(\pi)
$$

$$
\pi \sim \text{Dirichlet}([0.5, \dots, 0.5])
$$
$$
X_k  \sim \text{MultivariateNormal}(\mu_k, \Sigma_k)
$$


$$
\text{for } k \text{ in } 1, \dots, K:
$$
$$
\mu_k \sim \text{MultivariateNormal}\left( \mu_{0,k}, 0.1 \cdot I_D \right)
$$
$$
\Sigma_k = \text{diag}(\sigma_k) \cdot \Omega_k \cdot \text{diag}(\sigma_k)
$$
$$
\sigma_{k,d} \sim \text{HalfCauchy}(1) \quad \text{for } d \text{ in } 1, \dots, D
$$
$$
\Omega_k \sim \text{LKJ}(1)
$$

**Parameter Definitions:**
*   **Observed Data:**
    *   $x_i$: The $i$-th observed D-dimensional data point.

*   **Latent Variables (Inferred):**
    *   $z_i$: The integer cluster assignment for the $i$-th data point.
    *   $w$: The K-dimensional vector of mixture weights.
    *   $\mu_k$: The D-dimensional mean vector of the $k$-th cluster.
    *   $\Sigma_k$: The DxD covariance matrix of the $k$-th cluster (composed of $\sigma_k$ and $L_{\text{corr},k}$).

*   **Hyperparameters (Fixed):**
    *   $K$: The total number of clusters.
    *   $\alpha_0$: The concentration parameter vector for the Dirichlet prior on weights (e.g., `[1, 1, ..., 1]`).
    *   $\mu_0$: The prior mean for the cluster centers.
    *   $\Sigma_0$: The prior covariance for the cluster centers.

## Notes

::: callout-note
The primary challenge of the GMM compared to the DPMM is the need to **manually specify the number of clusters `K`**. If the chosen `K` is too small, the model may merge distinct clusters. If `K` is too large, it may split natural clusters into meaningless sub-groups. Therefore, applying a GMM often involves an outer loop of model selection where one fits the model for a range of `K` values and uses a scoring metric to select the best one.
