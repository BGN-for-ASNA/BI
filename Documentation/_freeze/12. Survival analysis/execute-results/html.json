When analyzing binary survival outcomes (e.g., alive or dead), we can use models such as Cox proportional hazards to evaluate the effect of predictors on survival probabilities.\n\nKey concepts include:\n\n1.  **Hazard Function**: The instantaneous risk of the event occurring at a given time.\n2.  **Survival Function**: The probability of surviving until a given time.\n3.  **Covariates**: Variables (e.g., age, treatment) that may affect survival probabilities.\n4.  **Baseline Hazard**: The hazard when all covariates are zero, which forms the reference for comparing different conditions.\n\n## Considerations\n\n::: callout-note\n\n- In survival analysis:\n\n  - The **baseline hazard** can follow distributions like Exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz, depending on the data.\n\n  - Censoring (when the event is not observed for some subjects) must be accounted for in the likelihood function. Proper handling is essential for unbiased results.\n\n- Bayesian survival models allow flexible handling of time-dependent covariates, random effects, and incorporate uncertainty more naturally than Frequentist methods.\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s an example of a Bayesian survival analysis using the **Bayesian Inference (BI)** package. The data come from a clinical trial of mastectomy for breast cancer. The goal is to estimate the effect of the `metastasized` covariate, coded as 0 (no metastasis) and 1 (metastasis), on the survival outcome `event` for each patient. Time is continuous and censoring is indicated by the event variable.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n\n### Python\n\n```python\nfrom BI import bi\nimport numpy as np\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n# Setup device------------------------------------------------\nm = bi(platform='cpu')\n\n# Import Data & Data Manipulation ------------------------------------------------\n# Import\nfrom importlib.resources import files\ndata_path = files('BI.resources.data') / 'mastectomy.csv'\nm.data(data_path, sep=',') \n\nm.df.metastasized = (m.df.metastasized == \"yes\").astype(np.int64)\nm.df.event = jnp.array(m.df.event.values, dtype=jnp.int32)\n\n## Create survival object\nm.models.survival.surv_object(time='time', event='event', cov='metastasized', interval_length=3)\n\n# Plot censoring ------------------------------------------------\nm.models.survival.plot_censoring(cov='metastasized')\n\n# Model ------------------------------------------------\ndef model(intervals, death, metastasized, exposure):\n    # Parameter prior distributions-------------------------\n    ## Base hazard distribution\n    lambda0 = m.dist.gamma(0.01, 0.01, shape= intervals.shape, name = 'lambda0')\n    ## Covariate effect distribution\n    beta = m.dist.normal(0, 1000, shape = (1,),  name='beta')\n    ### Likelihood\n    #### Compute hazard rate based on covariate effect\n    lambda_ = m.models.survival.hazard_rate(cov = metastasized, beta = beta, lambda0 = lambda0)\n    #### Compute exposure rates\n    mu = exposure * lambda_\n\n    # Likelihood calculation\n    y = m.dist.poisson(mu + jnp.finfo(mu.dtype).tiny, obs = death)\n\n# Run mcmc ------------------------------------------------\nm.fit(model, num_samples=500) \n\n# Summary ------------------------------------------------\nprint(m.summary())\n\n# Plot hazards and survival function ------------------------------------------------\nm.models.survival.plot_surv()\n```\n\n### R\n\n![](travaux-routiers.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Mathematical Details\n![](travaux-routiers.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n<!---\nThe model is defined as follows:\n\n$$\nS_{[i,t]} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\lambda_{[i,t]}) |_{S_{[i,t-1]}=1}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{[i,t]} = \\text{inv_logit}(\\alpha_{[t]} + \\beta_{[t]} X_{[i]} )\n$$\n\n\n$$\nN_i(t) \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i(t) Y_i(t))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\lambda_i(t) = \\lambda_{0}(t)\\exp(\\beta X_i)\n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{0} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(0.01, 0.01)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\beta \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 1000)\n$$\n\n\n\n\n-   Where:\n    -   $N_i(t)$ is the counting process for subject $i$, which counts the number of observed events up to time $t$. For survival analysis, this is typically 0 or 1.\n\n    *   **$Y_i(t)$ is the at-risk indicator**, taking a value of 1 if subject *i* is under observation and has not yet experienced an event just prior to time *t*, and 0 otherwise. This indicator is the mechanism that handles censoring:\n        *   If a subject is **censored** at time $t'$, their at-risk indicator $Y_i(t)$ remains 1 up to $t'$, signifying they were at risk during this period.\n        *   At the moment of censoring $t'$, no event is recorded (the counting process $N_i(t)$ does not increment).\n        *   For all subsequent times $t > t'$, the indicator $Y_i(t)$ switches to 0, effectively removing the individual from the risk set for any future calculations.\n\n    -   $\\lambda_i(t)$ is the hazard rate for subject $i$ at time $t$.\n\n    -   $\\lambda_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard rate function at time $t$. A key assumption is that this baseline hazard is the same for all subjects.\n\n    -   $X_i$ is the covariates for subject $i$.\n\n    -   $\\beta$ is the regression coefficients. \n\n-   **Priors:**\n    -   We assign prior distributions to the unknown parameters. The regression coefficients $\\beta$ are given a Normal prior.\n\n    -   The baseline hazard $\\lambda_0(t)$ is also treated as an unknown parameter and is often modeled non-parametrically, for instance, using a gamma process or as a piecewise constant function, where priors are placed on the hazard level in each time interval.\n\n\nThe key assumption of this model is that the hazard ratios are constant over time. Censoring is typically handled in the likelihood function used for estimation, not by multiplying the hazard function by a factor. The data for each subject $i$ is represented by a tuple $(t_i, \\delta_i, X_i)$, where $t_i$ is the observed time (either event or censoring time), $\\delta_i$ is an event indicator (1 if the event was observed, 0 if censored), and $X_i$ is the vector of covariates.\n--->\n## Reference(s)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model\nhttps://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/cox-proportional-hazard-regression.html\nhttps://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/survival_analysis/survival_analysis.html\nhttps://vflores-io.github.io/posts/20240924_numpyro_logreg_surv_analysis/np01_logreg_surv_analysis/\n\n",
